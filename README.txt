CONTENTS

Every unlicensed team has era-accurate logos, even on kits!
Every competiton has new logos apart from the World Cup and the fake continental cups.

NEW IN V1.1
New game story update.
Kick It Out anti-racism campaign adboards replaces some Adidas adboards.

NEW IN V1.2
Pyra and Maestro fixed some weird bugs on 3D kits by giving all logos 8px of margin. Also just looks cleaner IMO.
Intro changes, added SEGA back at the very least.
WARNING: If you downloaded on April 6th and you get blank textures, please redownload. I made a dumb mistake but I also fixed it using a bunch of code and some backups from Google.

NEW IN V1.3
The World Cup finally has a logo!
Some changes to the starting titles.

FIXED IN V1.3a
Intertoto Cup transparency issues.

NEW IN V1.4
Fixed incorrect facility texts by removing them. Turns out most of it was the same 6 texts recycled due to lack of space.
Fixes to dead links and other issues in credits.

NEW IN V1.4A
Fixed incorrect icon of Slovakian flag, thanks to Gingernut.

NEW IN V1.4B
Fixed incorrect icon of FCSK (Dutch 3rd tier), thanks to Dang Nguyen.

NEW IN V1.5
Fixed incorrect icons of Toronto (Lynx) and Kanagawa (Yokohama FC), thanks to Dang Nguyen.
Added more Special Thanks to credits.

KNOWN ISSUES
Licensed teams still have lowres logos.
Minor continental competitions lack logos.
The Premier League logo looks glitchy on the background of certain cutscenes.
WONTFIX: Some logos make no sense like the FA Trophy, or association logos for certain cups. This is due to very little information on secondary cups, horribly compressed JPG logos being the only ones available, or no 2nd cup existing at all... like Germany.
WONTFIX: Intro sequence with logo wheel at start of new game still has old logos. This screen appears exactly once, and while it annoys pedants like me... it's got some stupid and bad custom logos that aren't used ever again... so aren't worth replacing.
WONTFIX: The above also applies to competition final results. It's annoying to see the old logos in them, but the textures are really fucky and you need to enter every competiton to dump the textures, and Pyra hase't got the time to do that.

NOTES
I'm back again, and honestly? This is merely the beginning. :)
